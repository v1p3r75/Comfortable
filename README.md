# COMFORTABLE PHP

comfortable is a simple php framework that allows developers to quickly integrate their sites or web applications in a secure and very simple way.
This framework, through several functions and classes already written, allows developers to manage powerful features such as:
- Database management (Authentication, etc.);
- A very powerful CRUD;
- Route processing (GET, POST, UPDATE, etc.);
- Website security (CSXF, Middleware, ...);
- Integrated template engines;
- Etc, ...

In addition to its functionalities, the Comfortable team has developed a site management system based on the framework thanks to a very simple and intuitive CMS that can be used by everyone (even non-coders) to manage their site. .
The framework also composes a small 'cli' tool called: certainty that allows devs to go faster during development (creation of: routes, controllers, models; application start; ...)

Thank you for choosing Comfortable!
